#+DESCRIPTION: Docker Plugin Documentation

* Version 1.0.1

This package contains an implementation of a plugin for the [[https://www.pantsbuild.org/][pants
build system]] to build docker images from pants build targets.

* Requirements

This plugin supports pantsbuild 2.9 and requires python 3.7 or python
3.8 to be installed, as well as transitively any other pants
dependencies.

* Installation

To install from pypi in an existing pantsbuild project add to your
pants.toml file:

#+NAME: pants.toml
#+BEGIN_SRC: toml
[GLOBAL]
plugins = ["sendwave-pants-docker~=1.0"]
backend_packages = ["sendwave.pants_docker"]
#+END_SRC


* Overview
This plugin adds the 'docker' target that can be used with `pants
package` to build a docker image. Ensure that you have docker
installed & the daemon running when attempting to build an image.

The plugin will generate a Dockerfile & then then build that
dockerfile in a build context containing all dependent source files
(after stripping source roots). All source files will be copied into
the =/application/= directory in the generated image.

Python requirements will be installed into a virtualenv in the docker
image, which is activated by updating the PATH environment variable in
the generated imaage.

See =$ pants help docker= for information on possible values for the
docker target.

To add support for more targets in subsequent plugins (i.e. to
plug-into this plugin) add a rule mapping your Target/FieldSet to a
DockerComponent dataclass. Then add a
=UnionRule(DockerComponentFieldSet, {YourRuleInput}=, the =sources= in
the DockerComponent will be copied into the image and the =commands=
will be executed in the generated DockerFile.
* ChangeLog
* 1.0.1
+ Remove pants level docker process caching - we will not cache the image generation results from one pants run to another.
+ Log more information from the docker process
